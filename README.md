Socially
========

Socially is a Socialcast desktop client. Or rather, it will be when it's finished.

The design goals are to make a quick and responsive desktop application. I'm building Socially as I'm not happy with the official desktop application. I find it sluggish, and can never trust the notification which seems to come at multiple times, or not at all.

Socialcast has a rich feature-set, and I'll most likely never get around to implement all of it. The initial goal is to cover messages, posts, "thanks", search functionality and support for groups. I'll start to build a read-only client, and expand to writes as I go along.

Generally speaking, I'll try to stick with the standard look and feel to keep things familiar.

Any type of help is appreciated.

Current look and feel below.
